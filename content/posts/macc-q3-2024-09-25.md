Within this blog, We want to give an overview of all the feature in Q3 2024 that becomes available in General Availability and/or Technical Preview by Microsoft.
This information can be found at Microsoft <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/?query=confidential">Azure Updates</a> and <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-confidential-computing/bg-p/AzureConfidentialComputingBlog">Azure Confidential Computing Blog</a>.

<b> Features are now supported by Microsoft (GA): </b>
- [General available] <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/v2/GA-confidential-VMs-with-NVIDIA-H100-Tensor-Core-GPUs">Azure confidential VMs with NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs</a> <br>
  Microsoft is announcing the general availability of Azure confidential VMs with NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs and inviting customers to start deploying their production GPU workloads on these VMs. This NCC H100 v5 VM SKU is based on AMD 4th Gen EPYCTM processors with SEV-SNP technology paired with NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs. These VMs allow Azure customers to migrate their most sensitive GPU intensive workloads to Azure with minimal performance impact and without code changes. These NCC H100 v5 VM SKUs provide a hardware-based trusted execution environment (TEE) that enhances guest protection against potential access by the hypervisor and other host management code to VM memory and state, thereby safeguarding against unauthorized operator access. Customers can initiate attestation requests inside these VMs to verify that the VMs are running on a properly configured TEE before releasing keys and launching sensitive applications.

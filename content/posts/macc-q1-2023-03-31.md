Within this blog, We want to give an overview of all the feature in Q1 2023 that becomes available in General Availability, Technical Preview or End of Support by Microsoft.
This information can be found at Microsoft <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/?query=AKS">Azure Updates</a>.

<b> Features are now supported by Microsoft (GA): </b>
- [General available] none
<br>

<b> Features are not yet supported by Microsoft (GA) </b>
- [Public Preview] <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/public-preview-vbs-enclaves-for-always-encrypted-in-azure-sql-database/">Confidential containers on ACI</a> <br>
  Confidential containers on ACI, now available in public preview, enables you to run containers in a trusted execution environment (TEE) that provides hardware-based confidentiality and integrity protections for your container workloads. The TEE is currently supported by AMD <a href="https://www.amd.com/content/dam/amd/en/documents/epyc-business-docs/white-papers/SEV-SNP-strengthening-vm-isolation-with-integrity-protection-and-more.pdf">Secure Nested Paging hardware</a>. Confidential containers on ACI is supported as a new SKU that you can select when deploying your workload and will provide you with the following benefits for workloads processing highly sensitive data:  
    - Ability to lift and shift workloads to a confidential environment without needing to take any dependencies on any confidential computing libraries;
    - In-memory encryption of data with a hardware based dedicated key per container group helping to guard against attacks from a malicious OS, or Hypervisor components; 
  - Support for remote attestation to enabling a relying party to verify that a service is running in a TEE before processing any sensitive data. As part of confidential containers on ACI an agent will validate the authenticity of the hardware and application components which can be verified through a remote attestation service before any sensitive data is released to the TEE.

- [Public Preview] <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/public-preview-vbs-enclaves-for-always-encrypted-in-azure-sql-database/">VBS enclaves for Always Encrypted in Azure SQL Database</a> <br>
  Virtualization-based security (VBS) enclaves are a new addition to the Always Encrypted feature family. They bring the benefits of Always Encrypted with secure enclaves, such as rich confidential queries and in-place cryptographic operations, to all your Azure SQL Database offerings, independent from the underlying hardware. VBS enclaves enable you with the flexibility to protect your sensitive data and match the specific performance needs, budget, and regional availability requirements of your workloads.

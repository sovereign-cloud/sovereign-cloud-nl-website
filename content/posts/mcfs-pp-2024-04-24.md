On 24 of April, Microsoft released the latest news and announcements arround Cloud for Sovereignty via this <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/blog/government/sovereignty/2024/04/24/streamline-controls-with-microsoft-cloud-for-sovereignty/">blog</a>. We had the honour and opportunity to work close with the product team of Microsoft "Cloud for Sovereignty". This release, driven by customers and partner feedback, provides tools that simplify the configuration and deployment of complex sovereign controls and expand on best practice guidance. Let's take a look to the new features of this release!

  - Updated <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/industry/sovereignty/policy-portfolio-baseline">Policy portfolio</a>, by adding NATO’s D32 directive on information protection (preview) and Azure policy initiatives for <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/governance/policy/samples/nl-bio-cloud-theme">Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Cloud Controls Matrix</a>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/governance/policy/samples/nl-bio-cloud-theme">Netherlands BIO (Baseline Informatiebeveiliging Overheid)</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/Azure/cloud-for-sovereignty-policy-portfolio/tree/main/PolicyInitiatives/ACN">Policy portfolio</a>Italian National Cybersecurity Agency.

New assessment, policy compiler, and drift detection analysis tools to help better manage cloud environments. Introducing a new regional Microsoft Azure service that simplifies the management of Sovereign Landing Zone (SLZ) within the Azure Portal. The following tools are in technical preview:
  - The Search functionality within for "Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty Services" the <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/AssetMenuBlade/~/slzOverviewId/assetName/SovereigntyAsset/extensionName/Microsoft_Azure_CloudforSovereignty">Azure portal</a>;
  - The <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/AssetMenuBlade/~/mginfra_landingzonesconfiguration/assetName/SovereigntyAsset/extensionName/Microsoft_Azure_CloudforSovereignty">Landing Zone Configurations</a> in the Azure Portal;
  - The <a href="https://github.com/Azure/cloud-for-sovereignty-quickstarts/blob/main/prototypes/deploy-prototypes-1-getting-started.md#assessmentpreview">Assessment feature</a> - assesses various aspects, such as the SLZ Baseline Policy assignment, Custom Policy Initiatives usage, and individual policy assignments, offering results categorized as good, better, or best based on severity findings.
  - The <a href="https://github.com/Azure/cloud-for-sovereignty-quickstarts/blob/main/prototypes/deploy-prototypes-1-getting-started.md#policy-compilerpreview">Policy compiler</a> - It systematically analyzes your organization’s policy initiatives by examining key components—such as display names, descriptions, parameters, and effects. By comparing these elements across different policies, the tool detects redundancies, conflicts, and gaps. It then uses this analysis to provide a set of reconciled policy initiatives, making policy management more efficient and reliable.

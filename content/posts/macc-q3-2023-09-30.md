Within this blog, We want to give an overview of all the feature in Q2 2023 that becomes available in General Availability, Technical Preview or End of Support by Microsoft.
This information can be found at Microsoft <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/?query=AKS">Azure Updates</a>.

<b> Features are now supported by Microsoft (GA): </b>
- [General available] <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/general-availability-share-images-publicly-with-azure-compute-gallery-feature-community-gallery/">Share VM images publicly with community gallery - Azure Compute Gallery feature</a> <br>
  With community gallery, a new feature of Azure Compute Gallery, you can now easily share your VM images with the wider Azure community. By setting up a 'community gallery', you can group your images and make them available to other Azure customers. As a result, any Azure customer can utilize images from the community gallery to create resources such as virtual machines (VMs) and VM scale sets. Azure customers can then deploy VMs and VM scale sets using the portal, CLI, rest API, and PowerShell with the images you published and shared. Additionally, Fedora, CentOS Stream, AlmaLinux, FreeBSD, RockyLinux and other publishers will be able to share their non-commercial images and software packages with their customers using community galleries on Azure Compute Gallery.
  More capabilities include:
    - Browse view, an easy way to view and filter existing community images using the Azure portal;
    - Support for confidential VM supported images and trusted launch supported images based on regional availability.

- [General available] <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/generally-available-trusted-launch-as-default-for-vms-deployed-through-the-azure-portal/">Trusted launch as default for VMs deployed through the Azure portal</a> <br>
  <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/trusted-launch">Trusted launch</a>, hardens your Azure virtual machines with security features that allow administrators to deploy virtual machines with verified and signed bootloaders, OS kernels, and a boot policy. This is accomplished via trusted launch features: secure boot, vTPM, and boot integrity monitoring that protect against boot kits, rootkits, and kernel-level malware. With this announcement trusted launch is enabled by default.
    - <b>Secure Boot</b> protects against the installation of malware-based rootkits and boot kits and only allows signed OSes and drivers to boot;
    - <b>Virtual TPM (vTPM)</b> allows customers to protect keys, certificates, and secrets in the virtual machine;
    - <b>Measured Boot</b> examines and verifies the authenticity of bootloaderâ€™s signature and performs integrity measurement of the entire boot chain;
    - <b>Boot integrity</b> monitoring via Microsoft Azure Attestation and Azure Security Center generates integrity alerts, recommendations, and remediations if remote attestation fails.
As of this announcement, trusted launch is enabled by default for VMs when deployed through the Azure portal.

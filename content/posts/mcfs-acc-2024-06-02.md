<B>Sovereign cloud series - Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty - Part 5</b> <br>
This blog will give you an overview about Azure Confidential Computing. This information can be found at <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/confidential-computing/overview">Microsoft Learn</a>.

<Br>

<B>What is Confidential Computing</B> <br>
The <a href="https://confidentialcomputing.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2023/03/CCC_outreach_whitepaper_updated_November_2022.pdf">Confidential Computing Consortium (CCC)</a>, a division of the Linux Foundation, created the industry term "confidential computing". They define Confidential Compute as: <I> Confidential Computing protects data in use by performing computation in a hardware-based, attested Trusted Execution Environment. These secure and isolated environments prevent unauthorized access or modification of applications and data while they are in use, thereby increasing the security level of organizations that manage sensitive and regulated data.</I>

<I>Reducing the attack surface</I> <br>
The threat model seeks to undermine confidence or eliminate code and data access while it's being executed for a cloud provider operator or other actors in the tenant's domain. In Azure, this is accomplished through the use of a hardware root of trust that is not controlled by the cloud provider and intended to prevent unwanted access or environment manipulation.

When used with data encryption at rest and in transit, confidential computing extends data protections further to protect data whilst it's in use. This opens up options for businesses looking to further secure critical information and apps hosted in cloud environments.

<br>

<B>Usecases</B> <br>
You may protect your virtualized environment from the host, the hypervisor, the host administrator, and even the administrator of your own virtual machine by using confidential computing technologies. Microsoft provide a range of technologies based on your threat model that let you:
  - <b>Prevent unauthorized access:</B> Run sensitive data in the cloud. Trust that Azure provides the best data protection possible, with little to no change from what gets done today;
  - <b>Meet regulatory compliance:</B> Migrate to the cloud and keep full control of data to satisfy government regulations for protecting personal information and secure organizational IP.
  - <b>Ensure secure and untrusted collaboration:</B> Tackle industry-wide work-scale problems by combing data across organizations, even competitors, to unlock broad data analytics and deeper insights.
  - <b>Isolate processing:</b> Offer a new wave of products that remove liability on private data with blind processing. User data can't even be retrieved by the service provider.

<br>

<B>Common scenarios</B> <br>
Confidential computing can apply to various scenarios for protecting data in regulated industries such as government, financial services, and healthcare institutes. 

<img src="/images/mfcs11.png" width="600" height="800">


Common scenarios are shown below intended to have a starting point working with frameworks and services for confidential computing, as inspiration for building your own applications. 

<img src="/images/mfcs12.png" width="600" height="800">

<I>Secure multi-party computation</I> <br>
Information sharing between several parties is necessary for business transactions and collaborative projects. A lot of the time, private information is exchanged. The data could be private citizen data, bank records, medical records, personal information, etc. Public and private organizations require their data be protected from unauthorized access. These companies even wish to shield their data from data scientists, security architects, business advisors, and operators of computer equipment. You can process data from many sources with Azure Confidential Computing without disclosing the input data to third parties. This type of secure computation makes scenarios like fraud detection, anti-money laundering, and safe healthcare data analysis conceivable. Multiple sources can upload their data to one enclave in a virtual machine. One party tells the enclave to perform computation or processing on the data. No parties (not even the one executing the analysis) can see another party's data that was uploaded into the enclave. In secure multi-party computing, encrypted data goes into the enclave. The enclave decrypts the data using a key, performs analysis, gets a result, and sends back an encrypted result that a party can decrypt with the designated key.

<I>Legal or jurisdictional requirements</I> <br>
FSI and healthcare are common industries where legal and regulatory constraints that limit where certain workloads can be processed and be stored at-rest. In order to meet the following protection objectives, this use case is resolved by combining Azure Confidential Compute technologies with Azure Policy, Network Security Groups (NSGs), and Microsoft Entra Conditional Access. More detail can be found <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/confidential-computing/use-cases-scenarios#legal-or-jurisdictional-requirements">here</a>.
<br>

<I>Manufacturing - Intellectual Property (IP) protection</I> <br>
Manufacturing companies safeguard the intellectual property associated with their innovations and manufacturing processes. Frequently, these processes are outsourced to other parties, who handle the physical production processes. These environments may be considered as "hostile," as there are active threats to steal the intellectual property. More detail can be found <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/confidential-computing/use-cases-scenarios#manufacturing--ip-protection">here</a>.

<I>Enhanced customer data privacy</I> <br>
Azure Confidential Computing gives users the ability to precisely specify which hardware and software can access their workloads (data and code), and it provides the technological means by which this promise can be independently verified. To put it simply, customers have complete authority over their secrets. This is done by: <br>
  - Data sovereignty - protecting the data with sovereign controls in the public cloud. <br>
  - Reduced chain of trust - removing the cloud service provider from the trust chain. <br>
  - BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) scenarios - key creation by customer which is inaccessable for the cloud provider, secrets that never exist outside an HSM in plaintext form and cloud-based secured stored. <br>

<br>


<B>Confidential Computing on Azure</B> <br>
Microsoft Azure offers the following services with Confidential Compute.

<I>Virtual machines and containers</I> <br>
    - <b>Confidential VMs using AMD SEV-SNP</b>. DCasv5 and ECasv5 enable lift-and-shift of existing workloads and helps protect data from the cloud operator with VM-level confidentiality; <br>
    - <b>Confidential VMs using Intel TDX</b>. DCesv5 and ECesv5 enable lift-and-shift of existing workloads and helps protect data from the cloud operator with VM-level confidentiality; <br>
    - <b>VMs with Application Enclaves using Intel SGX</b>. DCsv2, DCsv3, and DCdsv3 enable organizations to create hardware enclaves. These secure enclaves help protect from cloud operators, and your own VM admins; <br>
    - <b>App-enclave aware containers running on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)</b>. Confidential computing nodes on AKS use Intel SGX to create isolated enclave environments in the nodes between each container application.<br>

<I>Confidential services </I> <br>
Azure offers various PaaS, SaaS and VM capabilities supporting or built upon confidential computing, this includes: <br>
    - <b>Azure Key Vault Managed HSM</b>, a fully managed, highly available, single-tenant, standards-compliant cloud service that enables you to safeguard cryptographic keys for your cloud applications, using FIPS 140-2 Level 3 validated Hardware Security Modules (HSM); <br>
    - <b>Always Encrypted with secure enclaves in Azure SQL</b>. The confidentiality of sensitive data is protected from malware and high-privileged unauthorized users by running SQL queries directly inside a TEE; <br>
    - <b>Azure Databricks</b> helps you bring more security and increased confidentiality to your Databricks Lakehouse using confidential VMs; <br>
    - <b>Azure Virtual Desktop</b> ensures a user’s virtual desktop is encrypted in memory, protected in use, and backed by hardware root of trust; <br>
    - <b>Microsoft Azure Attestation</b>, a remote attestation service for validating the trustworthiness of multiple Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and verifying integrity of the binaries running inside the TEEs; <br>
    - <b>Trusted Hardware Identity Management</b>, a service that handles cache management of certificates for all TEEs residing in Azure and provides trusted computing base (TCB) information to enforce a minimum baseline for attestation solutions; <br>
    - <b>Azure Confidential Ledger</b>. ACL is a tamper-proof register for storing sensitive data for record keeping and auditing or for data transparency in multi-party scenarios. It offers Write-Once-Read-Many guarantees, which make data non-erasable and non-modifiable. The service is built on Microsoft Research's Confidential Consortium Framework. <br>

<I>Supplementary offerings</I> <br>
    - <b>Azure IoT Edge</b> supports confidential applications that run within secure enclaves on an Internet of Things (IoT) device. IoT devices are often exposed to tampering and forgery because they're physically accessible by bad actors. Confidential IoT Edge devices add trust and integrity at the edge by protecting the access to data captured by and stored inside the device itself before streaming it to the cloud; <br>
    - <b>Confidential Inference ONNX Runtime</b> , a Machine Learning (ML) inference server that restricts the ML hosting party from accessing both the inferencing request and its corresponding response; <br>
    - <b>Trusted Launch</b> is available across all Generation 2 VMs bringing hardened security features – secure boot, virtual trusted platform module, and boot integrity monitoring – that protect against boot kits, rootkits, and kernel-level malware. <br>

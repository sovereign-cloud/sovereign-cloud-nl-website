<B>Sovereign cloud series - Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty - Part 5</b> <br>
This blog will give you an overview about Azure Confidential Computing. This information can be found at <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/confidential-computing/overview">Microsoft Learn</a>.

<Br>

<B>What is Confidential Computing</B> <br>
Confidential computing is an industry term established by the Confidential Computing Consortium (CCC), part of the Linux Foundation. The Confidential Computing Consortium (CCC) brings together hardware vendors, cloud providers, and software developers to accelerate the adoption of <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/confidential-computing/trusted-execution-environment">Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)</a> technologies and standards. They define Confidential Compute as: <I> Confidential Computing protects data in use by performing computation in a hardware-based, attested Trusted Execution Environment. These secure and isolated environments prevent unauthorized access or modification of applications and data while they are in use, thereby increasing the security level of organizations that manage sensitive and regulated data. </I>

<I>Reducing the attack surface</I> <br>
The threat model aims to reduce trust or remove the ability for a cloud provider operator or other actors in the tenant's domain accessing code and data while it's being executed. In Azure, this is accomplished through the use of a hardware root of trust that is independent of the cloud provider and intended to prevent unwanted access or environment manipulation.

When used with data encryption at rest and in transit, confidential computing extends data protections further to protect data whilst it's in use. This brings possibilities for organizations seeking further protections for sensitive data and applications hosted in cloud environments.

<br>

<B>Usecases</B> <br>
Using confidential computing technologies, you can harden your virtualized environment from the host, the hypervisor, the host admin, and even your own VM admin. Depending on your threat model, we offer various technologies that enable you to:
  - <b>Prevent unauthorized access:</B> Run sensitive data in the cloud. Trust that Azure provides the best data protection possible, with little to no change from what gets done today;
  - <b>Meet regulatory compliance:</B> Migrate to the cloud and keep full control of data to satisfy government regulations for protecting personal information and secure organizational IP.
  - <b>Ensure secure and untrusted collaboration:</B> Tackle industry-wide work-scale problems by combing data across organizations, even competitors, to unlock broad data analytics and deeper insights.
  - <b>Isolate processing:</b> Offer a new wave of products that remove liability on private data with blind processing. User data can't even be retrieved by the service provider.

<I>Common scenarios</I> <br>
Confidential computing can apply to various scenarios for protecting data in regulated industries such as government, financial services, and healthcare institutes. Examples of common scenarios: 

<img src="/images/mfcs12.png" width="600" height="800">

<I>Secure multi-party computation</I> <br>
Information sharing between several parties is necessary for business transactions and collaborative projects. A lot of the time, private information is exchanged. The data could be private citizen data, bank records, medical records, personal information, etc. Public and private organizations require their data be protected from unauthorized access. These companies even wish to shield their data from data scientists, security architects, business advisors, and operators of computer equipment. 

Azure confidential computing lets you process data from multiple sources without exposing the input data to other parties. 
Scenarios like anti-money laundering, fraud detection, and safe healthcare data analysis are made possible by this kind of secure computation.

Multiple sources can upload their data to one enclave in a virtual machine. One party tells the enclave to perform computation or processing on the data. No parties (not even the one executing the analysis) can see another party's data that was uploaded into the enclave. In secure multi-party computing, encrypted data goes into the enclave. The enclave decrypts the data using a key, performs analysis, gets a result, and sends back an encrypted result that a party can decrypt with the designated key.

<I>Legal or jurisdictional requirements</I> <br>
Commonly applicable to FSI and healthcare where there are legal or regulatory requirements that limit where certain workloads can be processed and be stored at-rest. To solve this use case a combination of Azure Confidential Compute technologies with Azure Policy, Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Microsoft Entra Conditional Access to ensure that the following protection goals are met. More detail can be found <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/confidential-computing/use-cases-scenarios#legal-or-jurisdictional-requirements">here</a>.
<br>

<I>Manufacturing - Intellectual Property (IP) protection</I> <br>
Manufacturing organizations protect the IP around their manufacturing processes and technologies, often manufacturing is outsourced to third parties who deal with the physical production processes, which could be considered ‘hostile’ environments where there are active threats to steal that IP. More detail can be found <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/confidential-computing/use-cases-scenarios#manufacturing--ip-protection">here</a>.

<I>Enhanced customer data privacy</I> <br>
Azure confidential computing allows customers to precisely define all the hardware and software that have access to their workloads (data and code), and it provides the technical mechanisms to verifiably enforce this guarantee. In short, customers retain full control over their secrets. This is done by: <br>
  - Data sovereignty - via Azure Confidential Computing with the ability to protect data sovereignty in the public cloud. <br>
  - Reduced chain of trust - Azure Confidential Computing offer the possibility to remove the cloud service provider from the trust chain. <br>
  - BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) scenarios - by using Azure Key Vault Managed HSM, for key creation which are inaccessable for the cloud provider. Secrets being transferred never exist outside an HSM in plaintext form, are client generated and managed and cloud-based secured stored. <br>

<br>


<B>Confidential Computing on Azure</B> <br>
Microsoft Azure offers the following services with Confidential Compute.

<I>Virtual machines and containers</I> <br>
    - <b>Confidential VMs using AMD SEV-SNP</b>. DCasv5 and ECasv5 enable lift-and-shift of existing workloads and helps protect data from the cloud operator with VM-level confidentiality; <br>
    - <b>Confidential VMs using Intel TDX</b>. DCesv5 and ECesv5 enable lift-and-shift of existing workloads and helps protect data from the cloud operator with VM-level confidentiality; <br>
    - <b>VMs with Application Enclaves using Intel SGX</b>. DCsv2, DCsv3, and DCdsv3 enable organizations to create hardware enclaves. These secure enclaves help protect from cloud operators, and your own VM admins; <br>
    - <b>App-enclave aware containers running on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)</b>. Confidential computing nodes on AKS use Intel SGX to create isolated enclave environments in the nodes between each container application.<br>

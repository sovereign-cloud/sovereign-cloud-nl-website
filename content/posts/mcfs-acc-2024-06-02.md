<B>Azure Confidential Computing (ACC)</b> <br>
This blog will give you an overview about Azure Confidential Computing. This information can be found at <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/confidential-computing/overview">Microsoft Learn</a>.

<Br>

<B>What is Confidential Computing</B> <br>
Confidential computing is an industry term established by the Confidential Computing Consortium (CCC), part of the Linux Foundation. The Confidential Computing Consortium (CCC) brings together hardware vendors, cloud providers, and software developers to accelerate the adoption of Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) technologies and standards. They define Confidential Compute as: <I> Confidential Computing protects data in use by performing computation in a hardware-based, attested Trusted Execution Environment.These secure and isolated environments prevent unauthorized access or modification of applications and data while they are in use, thereby increasing the security level of organizations that manage sensitive and regulated data. </I>.

<I>Reducing the attack surface</I> <br>
The threat model aims to reduce trust or remove the ability for a cloud provider operator or other actors in the tenant's domain accessing code and data while it's being executed. This is achieved in Azure using a hardware root of trust not controlled by the cloud provider, which is designed to ensure unauthorized access or modification of the environment.

When used with data encryption at rest and in transit, confidential computing extends data protections further to protect data whilst it's in use. This is beneficial for organizations seeking further protections for sensitive data and applications hosted in cloud environments.

<br>

<B>Usecases</B> <br>
Using confidential computing technologies, you can harden your virtualized environment from the host, the hypervisor, the host admin, and even your own VM admin. Depending on your threat model, we offer various technologies that enable you to:
  - <b>Prevent unauthorized access:</B> Run sensitive data in the cloud. Trust that Azure provides the best data protection possible, with little to no change from what gets done today;
  - <b>Meet regulatory compliance:</B> Migrate to the cloud and keep full control of data to satisfy government regulations for protecting personal information and secure organizational IP.
  - <b>Ensure secure and untrusted collaboration:</B> Tackle industry-wide work-scale problems by combing data across organizations, even competitors, to unlock broad data analytics and deeper insights.
  - <b>Isolate processing:</b> Offer a new wave of products that remove liability on private data with blind processing. User data can't even be retrieved by the service provider.

<I>Scenarios</I> <br>
Confidential computing can apply to various scenarios for protecting data in regulated industries such as government, financial services, and healthcare institutes. For example, preventing access to sensitive data helps protect the digital identity of citizens from all parties involved, including the cloud provider that stores it. The same sensitive data may contain biometric data that is used for finding and removing known images of child exploitation, preventing human trafficking, and aiding digital forensics investigations.

<I>Secure multi-party computation</I> <br>
Business transactions and project collaboration require sharing information amongst multiple parties. Often, the data being shared is confidential. The data may be personal information, financial records, medical records, private citizen data, etc. Public and private organizations require their data be protected from unauthorized access. Sometimes these organizations even want to protect data from computing infrastructure operators or engineers, security architects, business consultants, and data scientists.

Azure confidential computing lets you process data from multiple sources without exposing the input data to other parties. This type of secure computation enables scenarios such as anti-money laundering, fraud-detection, and secure analysis of healthcare data.
Multiple sources can upload their data to one enclave in a virtual machine. One party tells the enclave to perform computation or processing on the data. No parties (not even the one executing the analysis) can see another party's data that was uploaded into the enclave. In secure multi-party computing, encrypted data goes into the enclave. The enclave decrypts the data using a key, performs analysis, gets a result, and sends back an encrypted result that a party can decrypt with the designated key.

<I>Legal or jurisdictional requirements</I> <br>
Commonly applicable to FSI and healthcare where there are legal or regulatory requirements that limit where certain workloads can be processed and be stored at-rest. To solve this usecase a combination of Azure Confidential Compute technologies with Azure Policy, Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Microsoft Entra Conditional Access to ensure that the following protection goals are met. More detail can be found <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/confidential-computing/use-cases-scenarios#legal-or-jurisdictional-requirements">here</a>.
<br>

<I>Manufacturing - Interlectual Property (IP) protection</I> <br>
Manufacturing organizations protect the IP around their manufacturing processes and technologies, often manufacturing is outsourced to third parties who deal with the physical production processes, which could be considered ‘hostile’ environments where there are active threats to steal that IP. More detail can be found <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/confidential-computing/use-cases-scenarios#manufacturing--ip-protection">here</a>.

<I>Enhanced customer data privacy</I> <br>
Despite the security level provided by Microsoft Azure is quickly becoming one of the top drivers for cloud computing adoption, customers trust their provider to different extents. Customer asks for:
- Minimal hardware, software, and operational TCBs (trusted computing bases) for sensitive workloads.
- Technical enforcement, rather than just business policies and processes.
- Transparency about the guarantees, residual risks, and mitigations that they get.

Confidential computing goes in this direction by allowing customers incremental control over the TCB used to run their cloud workloads. Azure confidential computing allows customers to precisely define all the hardware and software that have access to their workloads (data and code), and it provides the technical mechanisms to verifiably enforce this guarantee. In short, customers retain full control over their secrets.

<B>Sovereign cloud series - Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty - Part 1</b> <br>
This blog will explain the Microsoft approach to achieve Sovereignty within the Microsoft Cloud. This information can be found at <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/sovereignty/sovereignty-capabilities">Microsoft Learn</a> and <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-confidential-computing/bg-p/AzureConfidentialComputingBlog">Azure Confidential Computing Blog</a>.

<B>What is Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty</B> <br>
In July 2022, Microsoft introduced Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty, a solution tailored for governments to deploy workloads in the Microsoft cloud while meeting their specific sovereignty, compliance, security, and policy needs. This innovation establishes software boundaries in the cloud, providing extra protection through hardware-based confidentiality and encryption controls. Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty offers enhanced tools, guidance, and guardrails for public cloud adoption with appropriate sovereign controls, enabling more control while leveraging the capabilities of the Microsoft Cloud to the fullest. Features such as scalability, elasticity, resiliency, compliance, agility, and cybersecurity make it a compelling choice for businesses looking to optimize their operations and enhance security, reaping the benefits of the cloud while meeting sovereignty and compliance demands. Embracing cloud computing while adhering to digital sovereignty requirements can be complex, varying significantly across organizations, industries, and regions.

The goal Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty is to simplify, standardize, and improve confidence in the digital sovereignty of the public cloud. Cloud for Sovereignty supports both green field scenarios, such as migration of on-premises workloads to the cloud, and brownfield implementations, such as aiming to improve the digital sovereignty and compliance of existing cloud workloads.

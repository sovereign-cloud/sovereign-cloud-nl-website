Within this blog, We want to give an overview of all the feature in Q1 2024 that becomes available in General Availability and/or Technical Preview by Microsoft.
This information can be found at Microsoft <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/?query=confidential">Azure Updates</a> and <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-confidential-computing/bg-p/AzureConfidentialComputingBlog">Azure Confidential Computing Blog</a>.

<b> Features are now supported by Microsoft (GA): </b>
- [General available] <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-confidential-computing/general-availability-azure-managed-hsm-backup-restore-when/ba-p/4025228">Azure Managed HSM Backup/Restore when Storage is Behind a Private Endpoint</a> <br>
  We are excited to announce the General Availability of support for Azure Key Vault Managed HSM backup/restore when the storage account is behind a private endpoint. We are giving customers a new way to back up and restore using a user assigned managed identity. This method allows customers to backup/restore regardless of whether public access is enabled or disabled. Further, by becoming a Microsoft Trusted Service, we have enhanced the backup and restore flow by allowing for private endpoint connection to Azure Storage accounts while backing up and restoring Managed HSM resources. This helps reduce the risk of exposure to public internet and helps address compliance needs.

- [General available] <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/general-availability-azure-virtual-network-encryption-2/">Azure Virtual Network encryption</a> <br>
  With Virtual Network encryption, customers can enable encryption of traffic between Virtual Machines and Virtual Machines Scale Sets within the same virtual network and between regionally and globally peered virtual networks. This new feature enhances the existing encryption in transit capabilities in Azure. Azure Virtual Network encryption is available in the following regions: UK South, Swiss North and West Central US.

- [General available] <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/dedicated-clusters-in-azure-monitor-logs-now-support-any-commitment-tier/">Dedicated clusters in Azure Monitor logs now support any commitment tier</a> <br>
  Microsoft is pleased to announce that it is now possible to create dedicated clusters in public and sovereign clouds at any commitment tiers, starting at a minimum of 100GB per day. This capability is provided in response to your feedback to reduce the required commitment tier in Azure Monitor log dedicated clusters, especially in cases where ingestion did not reach the minimum tier level. Configuration is first available via <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/rest/api/loganalytics/clusters/create-or-update?view=rest-loganalytics-2023-09-01&tabs=HTTP">REST</a>.
  The minimum commitment tier in a dedicated cluster is essential to guarantee the provisioning of a managed Azure Data Explorer (ADX) cluster in the backend. This provisioned cluster is responsible for supporting data ingestion and queries related to the workspaces linked to the cluster. The billing of the cluster initiates upon provisioning, irrespective of the actual data ingestion and usage. Therefore, the implementation of a commitment tier becomes necessary to align with this billing structure.

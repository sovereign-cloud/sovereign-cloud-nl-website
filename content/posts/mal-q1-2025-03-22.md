Within this blog, We want to give an overview of all the features in Q1 2025 that becomes available in General Availability and/or Technical Preview by Microsoft, which help to implement a `Hybrid Cloud model`. Azure Local helps to deploy workloads to your own data-center managed `HCI` infrastructure. If you aren't yet familiar with Azure Local, it's announced at Microsoft Ignite 2024. The announcement can be read at the Microsoft <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azurearcblog/introducing-azure-local-cloud-infrastructure-for-distributed-locations-enabled-b/4296017">Tech Community</a> and <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/category/azure/blog/azurearcblog">Azure Arc Blog</a>.

Read more about Architecture best practices and learn how Azure Local helps to address <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/service-guides/azure-local">data sovereignty, regulation and compliance challenges</a>.

Let's dive into release `2411`. Full release notes can be seen at <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-local/whats-new?view=azloc-2411">What's new in Azure Local?</a>. We picked our three favorite ones:

<b> Features are now supported by Microsoft (GA): </b>
- [AKS on Azure Local (GA)] - This release has several new features and enhancements for AKS on Azure Local. For more information, see What's new in AKS on Azure Local. Of course next to azure arc virtual machines and databases.

<b> Features are now supported by Microsoft as Public Preview: </b>
- [Azure Local for disconnected operations (Preview)] - Azure Local is now available for disconnected operations. Disconnected operations for Azure Local enable the deployment and management of Azure Local instances without a connection to the Azure public cloud.

This feature allows you to build, deploy, and manage virtual machines (VMs) and containerized applications using select Azure Arc-enabled services from a local control plane, providing a familiar Azure portal and CLI experience. If you want to learn more about this feature, just read <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-local/manage/disconnected-operations-overview?view=azloc-2411">Learn Documentation</a>.
- [Deploy Azure Local with Local Identity (Preview)] - Starting this release, you can deploy Azure Local using Local identity with Azure Key Vault. By integrating with Key Vault and using certificate-based authentication, security posture is enhanced and operations continuity is ensured. This approach offers minimal edge infrastructure, a secure secret store, and simplified management by consolidating secrets in a single vault. Additionally, it streamlines deployment by eliminating dependencies on Active Directory systems and simplifying firewall configurations.

This is just a glance what is possible with Azure Local. Enjoy reading!

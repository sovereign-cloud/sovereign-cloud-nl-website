<B>Sovereign cloud series - Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty - Part 3</b> <br>
This blog will give you an overview about Azure Key Vault Managed HSM, one of the several <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/key-management#whats-next">key management solutions in Azure</a>. This information can be found at <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/managed-hsm/overview">Microsoft Learn</a>.

<Br>

<B>What is Azure Key Vault Managed HSM</B> <br>
Azure Key Vault Managed HSM (Hardware Security Module) is a fully managed, highly available, single-tenant, standards-compliant cloud service that enables you to safeguard cryptographic keys for your cloud applications, using FIPS 140-2 Level 3 validated HSMs.

<br>

<B>Why use Managed HSM</B> <br>
  - Fully managed, highly available, single-tenant HSM as a service <br>
      - Fully managed: HSM provisioning, configuration, patching, and maintenance is handled by the service;  <br>
      - Highly available: Each HSM cluster consists of multiple HSM partitions. If the hardware fails, member partitions for your HSM cluster will be automatically migrated to healthy nodes. <br>
      - Single-tenant: Each Managed HSM instance is dedicated to a single customer and consists of a cluster of multiple HSM partitions. Each HSM cluster uses a separate customer-specific security domain that cryptographically isolates each customer's HSM cluster. <br>
  - Access control, enhanced data protection & compliance <br>
      - Centralized key management: Manage critical, high-value keys across your organization in one place. With granular per key permissions, control access to each key on the 'least privileged access' principle. <br>
      - Isolated access control: Managed HSM "local RBAC" access control model allows designated HSM cluster administrators to have complete control over the HSMs that even management group, subscription, or resource group administrators cannot override. <br>
      - Private endpoints: Use private endpoints to securely and privately connect to Managed HSM from your application running in a virtual network. <br>
      - FIPS 140-2 Level 3 validated HSMs: Protect your data and meet compliance requirements with FIPS (Federal Information Protection Standard) 140-2 Level 3 validated HSMs. Managed HSMs use Marvell LiquidSecurity HSM adapters. <br>
      - Monitor and audit: fully integrated with Azure monitor. Get complete logs of all activity via Azure Monitor. Use Azure Log    Analytics for analytics and alerts. <br>
      - Data residency: Managed HSM doesn't store/process customer data outside the region the customer deploys the HSM instance in.
  - Integrated with Azure and Microsoft PaaS/SaaS services <br>
      - Generate (or import using BYOK) keys and use them to encrypt your data at rest in Azure services such as Azure Storage, Azure SQL, Azure Information Protection, and Customer Key for Microsoft 365. For a more complete list of Azure services which work with     Managed HSM, see Data Encryption Models. <br>
  - Uses same API and management interfaces as Key Vault <br>
      - Easily migrate your existing applications that use a vault (a multi-tenant) to use Managed HSMs. <br>
      - Use same application development and deployment patterns for all your applications irrespective of key management solution in use: multi-tenant vaults or single-tenant Managed HSMs. <br>
  - Import keys from your on-premises HSMs <br>
      - Generate HSM-protected keys in your on-premises HSM and import them securely into Managed HSM. <br>

<B>Deployment</B> <br>
Deployment can be done via AzureCLI, PowerShell or via ARM. For more information, click <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/managed-hsm/quick-create-template">here</a> to reach the Microsoft Learn documentation.

<br>

<B>Risks of using HSM</B> <br>
Important to know, is that when you are using a HSM, the primary (master) key is very important. When this key is compromised or lost, all the data which is encrypted with this key is unaccessable and lost as well. The Cloud Provider (in this case, Microsoft) cannot help you in restoring the data.

<br>

<B>Limits of the HSM</B> <br>
Some limitations out of the field: <Br>
  - HSM cannot create certificates. For this you still need to use Azure KeyVault, which can result in changing Sovereign cloud policyset initiative; <br>
  - Creating keys and exchange them with internal teams, is a responsibility from one team. Self-service offering is currently not possible because of the current implementation of RBAC. This is best practice advice by Microsoft and the productteams working on the Managed HSM.
  - <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/managed-hsm/key-rotation">Automated key rotation</a> works great for Confidential Databricks (takes a day) and currently not for Azure Confidential VM's. To make it work, you must manually switch of the Azure Confidential VM, and then the replace the new HSM key. 

<br>

<B>Best practices for securing Managed HSM</B> <br>
Below, you will find the best practices for securing your Azure Key Vault Managed HSM key management system. For a full list of security recommendations, see the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/key-vault-managed-hsm-security-baseline">Azure Managed HSM security baseline</a>.
  - Control access to your managed HSM
      - Create a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/concept-learn-about-groups">Microsoft Entra security group</a> for the HSM Administrators (instead of assigning the Administrator role to individuals) to prevent "administration lockout" if an individual account is deleted;
      - Lock down access to your management groups, subscriptions, resource groups, and managed HSMs. Use Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) to control access to your management groups, subscriptions, and resource groups.
      - Create per-key role assignments by using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/managed-hsm/access-control#data-plane-and-managed-hsm-local-rbac">Managed HSM local RBAC</a>.
      - To maintain separation of duties, avoid assigning multiple roles to the same principals.
      - Use the least-privilege access principle to assign roles.
      - Create a custom role definition by using a precise set of permissions.
  - Create backups
      - Be sure that you create regular <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/managed-hsm/backup-restore">backups</a> of your managed HSM. You can create backups at the HSM level and for specific keys.
  - Turn on logging via Azure Policy
      - <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/managed-hsm/logging">Turn on logging</a> for your HSM. You also can set up alerts.
  - Turn on recovery options
      - <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/managed-hsm/soft-delete-overview">Soft-delete</a>, which results when the HSM is accidently is removed, it will be marked for deletion and removed after the retention time is reached. You can choose a retention period of between 7 and 90 days;
      - Purge protection, which to prevent immediate permanent deletion of the HSM or keys. When purge protection is on, the managed HSM or keys remain in a deleted state until the retention period has ended.

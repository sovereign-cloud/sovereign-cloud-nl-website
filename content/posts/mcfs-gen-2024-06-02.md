<B>Sovereign cloud series - Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty</b> <br>
This blog will explains the Microsoft approach to achieve Sovereignty within the Microsoft Cloud. This information can be found at  <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/sovereignty/sovereignty-capabilities">Microsoft Learn</a> and <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-confidential-computing/bg-p/AzureConfidentialComputingBlog">Azure Confidential Computing Blog</a>.

<B>What is Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty</B> <br>
In July 2022, Microsoft announced Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty, a new solution that enables governments to deploy workloads in Microsoft Cloud while helping meet their specific sovereignty, compliance, security, and policy requirements. Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty creates software boundaries in the cloud to establish the extra protection that governments require, using hardware-based confidentiality and encryption controls. Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty provides more tools, guidance, and guardrails for public cloud adoption with appropriate sovereign controls. It helps to extend the amount of control while maximizing the value and capabilities of the hyperscale Microsoft Cloud. Adopting cloud computing while meeting digital sovereignty requirements is complex and can differ greatly between organizations, industries, and geographies.

Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty addresses the sovereignty needs of government organizations. Further, Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty is customizable and adheres to evolving local policies and regulatory requirements around the handling of data. Governments need not choose between digital innovation and control over their data, and digital workloads. They can implement secure, consistent, and compliant environments and adhere to evolving local regulations while taking full advantage of the cloud. The benefits and value of running your applications in the Azure public cloud are substantial and include scalability, elasticity, resiliency, compliance, agility, and unmatched cybersecurity. With Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty, you can meet digital sovereignty and compliance requirements and still gain the benefits of the public cloud.

Cloud for Sovereignty aims to simplify, standardize, and improve confidence in the digital sovereignty of the public cloud by providing tools and guidance throughout the cloud implementation lifecycle for IT professionals, information security officers, and decision makers. Cloud for Sovereignty supports both green field scenarios, such as migration of on-premises workloads to the cloud, and brownfield implementations, such as aiming to improve the digital sovereignty and compliance of existing cloud workloads.

Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty provides access to codified architectures, workload templates, and tooling to help create compliant environments that meet sovereignty, privacy, and regulatory requirements. Cloud for Sovereignty capabilities capitalizes on existing concepts and services such as Infrastructure-as-Code, Azure Policy, and Policy-as-Code. The capabilities are:
  - The <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/sovereignty/slz-overview#overview-of-the-sovereign-landing-zone">Sovereign Landing Zone</a>, a variant of the Azure landing zone opinionated towards digital sovereignty (data residency, confidential computing, and more customer control over data); <br>
  - <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/sovereignty/workload-templates#workload-templates-for-sovereign-landing-zone">Workload templates</a>, like <a href="https://github.com/Azure/cloud-for-sovereignty-quickstarts/blob/main/workloadAccelerators/confidentialVirtualMachine/docs/cvmAccelerator.md">Confidential VM</a> that accelerate the deployment of Azure workloads that are compatible with the SLZ policies by design; <br>
  - A <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/sovereignty/policy-portfolio-baseline#microsoft-cloud-for-sovereignty-policy-portfolio">policy portfolio</a>, like the <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/tree/master/built-in-policies/policySetDefinitions">Baseline informatiebeveiliging Overheid or BIO in Dutch</a>, including the Sovereignty Baseline policy initiatives and policy initiatives with their mappings specific to a given country/region. 

<br>

<I>Compliance and transparency</I> <br>
Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty builds on top of the compliance and transparency capabilities that Microsoft already provides. Eligible customers can also take advantage of increased transparency over – and into – their environment's operations with tools and programs such as source code review, access to technical data, and transparency reports. For qualified customers and government agencies, Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty provides More transparency into Microsoft activities through <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/sovereignty/transparency-logs">transparency logs</a>.

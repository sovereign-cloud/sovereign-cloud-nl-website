<B>Sovereign Landing Zone</b> <br>
This blog will give you an overview about Sovereign Landing Zone. This information can be found at <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/sovereignty/slz-overview#overview-of-the-sovereign-landing-zone">Microsoft Learn</a>.

<Br>

<B>What is Sovereign Landing Zone</B> <br>
The Sovereign Landing Zone (SLZ) is a variant of the enterprise scale Azure Landing Zone intended for organizations that need advanced sovereign controls. The SLZ helps organizations meet their regulatory compliance requirements through Azure-native Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) and Policy-as-Code (PaC) capabilities. Using a configurable landing zone empowers organizations with tools to address their sovereignty needs by enforcing resources to be compliant with policies defined with Azure Policy.

<br>

<B>Why use the Sovereign Landing Zone</B> <br>
Data can only remain sovereign when the owner has exclusive control over it. In Azure, exclusive control means: <br>
  - Being the only entity that can grant the permissions necessary for users and workloads to access and process the data; <br>
  - Approving the regions that workloads can be deployed into. <br>

<br>

Technical controls to protect against unauthorized data access is necessary at all levels. Therefore granting access to operators of cloud providers and managed services providers should also be explicit. The SLZ provides an opinionated architecture that enables an organization to meet their sovereignty needs while being configured via a singular configuration file and entirely deployable by a singular script. These sovereignty needs are met by combining: <Br>
  - Aligning to the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/overview">Cloud Adoption Framework</a> to simplify adoption; <br>
  - Incorporating the technical guardrails provided by the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/sovereignty/policy-portfolio-baseline#microsoft-cloud-for-sovereignty-policy-portfolio">policy portfolio</a>, including the Sovereignty Baseline policy initiatives; <br>
  - Enabling policy configuration to allow organizations to customize their data sovereignty needs.
  - Streamlining the use of <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/sovereignty/azure-confidential-computing#azure-confidential-computing">Azure Confidential Computing</a> services.

<br>

<B>When use the Sovereign Landing Zone (SLZ) instead of Azure Landing Zone (ALZ)?</B> <br>
The Sovereign Landing Zone (SLZ) is a variant of the <a href="https://github.com/Azure/ALZ-Bicep">Azure Landing Zone (ALZ) Bicep repository</a>, meaning it includes additional Landing Zone Management Groups and Policy Assignments.

The <a href="https://github.com/Azure/sovereign-landing-zone">SLZ</a> uses the same code base as ALZ Bicep and comes with: <br>
  - Additional orchestration and deployment automation capabilities; <br>
  - An opinionated landing zone design for data sovereignty and confidential computing requirements; <br>
  - Additional Azure Policy Initiatives and Policy assignments to help meet sovereignty requirements for public sector customers, partners and ISVs. <br>

<br>

A common question related to SLZ is when an organization should use one landing zone over the other. Both the ALZ and SLZ teams recommend the following guidance. <br>
Use ALZ when you prioritize: <br>
  - Default option for most customers across various industries that can be built upon; <br>
  - Detailed configuration and customization options over the entire environment; <br>
  - Multiple <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/architecture/landing-zones/landing-zone-deploy">deployment options</a> including Portal, Bicep and Terraform; <br>

<img src="/images/mcfs5.png" width="600" height="800">

<br>
Use SLZ when you prioritize: <br>
  - Public sector customers focused on digital sovereignty requirements; <br>
  - Streamlined data governance capabilities enforced by policy and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/sovereignty/azure-confidential-computing#azure-confidential-computing">Azure Confidential Computing</a>; <br>
  - Simplified deployment experience when using <a href="https://github.com/Azure/cloud-for-sovereignty-policy-portfolio">region-specific policy initiatives</a>, like the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/governance/policy/samples/nl-bio-cloud-theme">Baseline informatiebeveiliging Overheid or BIO in Dutch</a>; <br>
  - Deployment of <a href="https://github.com/Azure/cloud-for-sovereignty-quickstarts">workload templates</a> to promote sovereign migration efforts. <br>

<br> 

<B><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/sovereign-landing-zone">Sovereign landing zone design areas</a></B> <br>
The Azure landing zone architecture consists of eight <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/sovereign-landing-zone">design areas</a>. Each design area describes factors to consider before you deploy a landing zone. The following sections describe additional considerations that apply when you deploy the sovereign landing zone. Besides the Azure landing zone guidance, also keep these new considerations in mind.

<I>Resource organisation</I> <br>
The following components will be deployed: <br>
  - Management groups for confidential compute - possibility to enforce for policy initiatives, offering controls such as resource deployment location, resource deployment types, and encryption; <br>
  - Microsoft Cloud for <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/sovereignty/policy-portfolio-baseline">Sovereignty policy baseline </a><br>
      - Policy enforcement on confidential computing, protecting workloads at rest, in transit and while in use, which removes Microsoft from the trust chain.
      - Location policies, which are also deployed by default to provide cloud admin control over where Azure resources can be deployed;
      - Key management, which is controlled by a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 level-3 validated HSM and enforced by policy.

<br>

<I>Network topology and connectivity</I> <br>
The sovereign landing zone focuses on operational control of data at rest, in transit, and in use. Components to take into consideration: <br> 
  - Network traffic encryption - For best practices for network encryption, click <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/define-network-encryption-requirements">here</a>; <br>
  - Internet inbound and outbound connectivity - like Azure Firewall, DDOS and central Azure Bastion infrastructure.

<br>

<I>Security</I> <br>
The sovereign landing zone architecture makes use of confidential computing in the confidential landing zones. The following sections describe services that provide support for Azure confidential computing:
  - <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/managed-hsm/overview">Azure Key Vault Managed HSM</a> - requirement for deploying Confidential Computing resources. For design for considerations and recommendations, click <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/design-area/encryption-and-keys">here</a>. <br>
  - <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/confidential-computing/guest-attestation-confidential-vms">Azure Attestation</a> - helps to confirm that a confidential VM runs on a hardware-based trusted execution environment (TEE) with security features like isolation and integrity enabled.

<br>

<I>Governance</I> <br>
In most cases, Microsoft personnel perform operations, support, and troubleshooting, and no access to customer data is required. Occasionally, a Microsoft engineer needs to access customer data. These cases can come up in response to customer-initiated support tickets or when Microsoft identifies a problem. <Br>
  - <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/customer-lockbox-overview">Customer Lockbox</a> for Microsoft Azure - feature provides an interface that you can use to review and then approve or reject customer data access requests. <br>

<br>

<I>Platform automation and DevOps</I> <br>
The sovereign landing zone code is available as a <a href="https://github.com/Azure/sovereign-landing-zone">GitHub repository</a>.
You can deploy the entire landing zone, or you can deploy one component at a time. When you deploy individual components, you can integrate them into your existing deployment workflow. For deployment guidance, click <a href="https://github.com/Azure/sovereign-landing-zone/blob/main/docs/03-Deployment-Overview.md">here</a>. The GitHub repository includes the following sovereign landing zone components: <br>
  - Bootstrap: Sets up the management group hierarchy and creates the subscriptions as dictated by the architecture of the sovereign landing zone. These elements are deployed under the tenant root group of the Azure customer tenant; <br>
  Platform: Sets up the hub network and the logging resources that are used by the sovereign landing zone platform and workloads; <br>
  - Compliance: Creates and assigns the default policy sets and the custom policies that are enforced in the environment; <br>
  - Dashboard: Provides you with a visual representation of your resource compliance. <br>

<br>

<I>Compliance Dashboards</I> <br>
This <a href="https://github.com/Azure/sovereign-landing-zone/blob/main/docs/10-Compliance-Dashboard.md">dashboard</a>  helps you validate the sovereign landing zone against your requirements and local laws and regulations. Specifically, the dashboard gives you insight into resource-level compliance against: <br>
  - The baseline policies that are deployed with the sovereign landing zone;
  - Other custom compliance that has been deployed.

<br>

<I>Other tools</I> <br>
More tools are being released (currently in Public Preview) to help you further.

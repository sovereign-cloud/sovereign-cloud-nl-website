<B>Microsoft Azure Attestation</b> <br>
This blog will give you an overview about Microsoft Azure Attestation. This information can be found at <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/attestation/overview">Microsoft Learn</a>.

<Br>

<B>Microsoft Azure Attestation</B> <br>
Microsoft Azure Attestation is a unified solution for remotely verifying the trustworthiness of a platform and integrity of the binaries running inside it. The service supports attestation of the platforms backed by Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) alongside the ability to attest to the state of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) such as Intel® Software Guard Extensions (SGX) enclaves, Virtualization-based Security (VBS) enclaves, Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs), Trusted launch for Azure VMs and Azure confidential VMs.

Attestation is a process for demonstrating that software binaries were properly instantiated on a trusted platform. Remote relying parties can then gain confidence that only such intended software is running on trusted hardware. Azure Attestation is a unified customer-facing service and framework for attestation.

Azure Attestation enables cutting-edge security paradigms such as Azure Confidential computing and Intelligent Edge protection. Customers have been requesting the ability to independently verify the location of a machine, the posture of a virtual machine (VM) on that machine, and the environment within which enclaves are running on that VM. Azure Attestation empowers these and many additional customer requests.

Azure Attestation receives evidence from compute entities, turns them into a set of claims, validates them against configurable policies, and produces cryptographic proofs for claims-based applications (for example, relying parties and auditing authorities).

<br>

<B>Use cases</B> <br>
Azure Attestation provides comprehensive attestation services for multiple environments and distinctive use cases:
  - <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/attestation/overview#sgx-enclave-attestation">SGX enclave attestation</a> - Intel® Software Guard Extensions (SGX) refers to hardware-grade isolation, which is supported on certain Intel CPU models. SGX enables code to run in sanitized compartments known as SGX enclaves. <br>
  - <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/attestation/overview#open-enclave-attestation">Open Enclave attestation</a> - a collection of libraries targeted at creating a single unified enclaving abstraction for developers to build TEE-based applications. It offers a universal secure app model that minimizes platform specificities. <br>
  - <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/attestation/overview#tpm-attestation">TPM attestation</a> - devices with a TPM can rely on attestation to prove that boot integrity isn't compromised and use the claims to detect feature state enablement during boot. <br>
  - <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/attestation/overview#amd-sev-snp-attestation">AMD SEV-SNP attestation</a> - Azure Confidential VM (CVM) is based on AMD processors with SEV-SNP technology. CVM offers VM OS disk encryption option with platform-managed keys or customer-managed keys and binds the disk encryption keys to the virtual machine's TPM. The service validates the measurements and issues an attestation token that is used to release keys from Managed-HSM or Azure Key Vault. The attestation and key release process is performed automatically on each CVM boot, and the process ensures the CVM boots up only upon successful attestation of the hardware. <br>
  - <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/attestation/overview#trusted-launch-attestation">Trusted Launch attestation</a> - Azure customers can prevent bootkit and rootkit infections by enabling trusted launch for their virtual machines (VMs). An attestation failure indicates potential malware, which is surfaced to customers via Microsoft Defender for Cloud, through Alerts and Recommendations. <br>

<br>

<B>Azure Attestation runs in a TEE (Trusted Execution Environments)</B> <br>
Azure Attestation is critical to Confidential Computing scenarios, as it performs the following actions: <br>
  - Verifies if the enclave evidence is valid; <br>
  - Evaluates the enclave evidence against a customer-defined policy; <br>
  - Manages and stores tenant-specific policies; <br>
  - Generates and signs a token that is used by relying parties to interact with the enclave. <br>

<br>

<B>Why use Azure Attestation</B> <br>
Azure Attestation is the preferred choice for attesting TEEs as it offers the following benefits: <br>
  - Unified framework for attesting multiple environments such as TPMs, SGX enclaves and VBS enclaves; <br>
  - Allows creation of custom attestation providers and configuration of policies to restrict token generation; <br>
  - Protects its data while-in use with implementation in an SGX enclave or Confidential Virtual Machine based on AMD SEV-SNP; <br>
  - Highly available service. <br>

<br>

<B>Deployment</B> <br>
Deployment can be done via AzureCLI, PowerShel, Terraform, Bicep or via ARM.

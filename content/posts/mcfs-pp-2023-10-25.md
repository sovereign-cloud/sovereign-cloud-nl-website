This week, Microsoft has announced via this <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-confidential-computing/private-preview-azure-managed-hsm-backup-restore-when-storage/ba-p/3964407">blog</a> the private preview of Azure Managed HSM Backup/Restore support for storage accounts behind a private endpoint. This is an important feature within *Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty* environments to manage your own keys (BYOK).This type of keys are also know as Customer Managed Keys (CMK).

This way Azure Managed HSM becomes a *Microsoft Trusted Service* that helps customers to safely backup and restore Managed HSM resources through a Private Endpoint without exposure to the public Internet. Additionally it helps customers to ensure compliancy with Sovereign controls for workloads that are classified as Confidential.
